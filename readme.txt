A simple way to display events and sessions from MeetingTruth.com on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Meeting Truth is a comprehensive suite of meeting management tools for the nondual community, and was developed entirely from the ground up with Nondual Satsang and Retreat organisers in mind.

The Meeting Truth Events plugin allows you to easily display events and sessions from the MeetingTruth.com website on your WordPress website. Visitors to your site can browse through a selection of events, filtered either by teacher or by country, then book tickets to the events.

The plugin can be configured to either send visitors to MeetingTruth.com to book their tickets, or by filling out the booking on your own site then paying via PayPal. All booking details are collected on your Meeting Truth dashboard to provide you with a comprehensive suite of event management tools.

The plugin can be easily styled to suit your current website design by entering the colours that define your site, and choosing from one of two layouts.

When you post your events on Meeting Truth, your events page on your website will automatically updates, and your events will also be advertised on other nondual websites such as satsangteachers.com, with others coming very soon.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `meetingtruth` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the 'Meeting Truth Events' page that appears under 'Settings'
